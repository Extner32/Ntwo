## the goal
- Open source and free forever
- allow for user-created maps (made in the Godot editor and then used in the game)
- Realistic physics
- Good preformance (should easily run on intigrated gpu's with the right settings), but also nice visuals if your computer can handle it.

## current working features:
- drone physics with PID controllers (this will probably keep getting improved during development)
- analog screen effect shader
